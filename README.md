<h1>Read Me</h1>
This repository contains two folders used in creating the Second Event Trigger, either on an Arduino-based board, or a custom made board (Recovery Board)

<h2>Arduino Board</h2>
The Arduino Board code is split into two:
<h3>1) Libraries</h3>
The libraries are Arduino libraries (you can simply download them from the Arduino IDE, it's way simpler that way, or take the code and upload them through the Arduino IDE
<h3>2) .ino Code</h3>
This code is the actual functional code. The titles are fairly self explanatory, the rocketTeamSketch is the equivalent of main.c - every other file is the equivalent of .h and .c files, with the functions related to each sensor/extra functions.

<h2> Recovery Board </h2>
The Recovery Board is mostly under construction right now. The best way to explore it is to download it entirely and upload it to the STM32IDE as a project (and hope for the best).
